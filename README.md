## Problem Description

The problem this project addresses is identifying the breed of a dog from an image. This could be useful for various applications, such as building a mobile app that identifies dog breeds in real-time.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is the Dog Breed Identification dataset from Kaggle. It contains images of 120 different dog breeds.

- **Training set:** Approximately 10,000+ images with labels.
- **Test set:** Images without labels (for making predictions).

You can find the dataset here: [[Link to Kaggle dataset page]](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data)

## Features

The key features of this project and dataset include:

- **Image data:** Working with unstructured image data requires deep learning techniques.
- **Multi-class classification:** The project involves classifying images into 120 distinct dog breeds.
- **Transfer learning:** Utilizing pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub to leverage existing knowledge for image classification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab environment (recommended) or a local environment with Jupyter Notebook support.
- Required libraries: TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib.

### Running the Notebook

1.  Clone this repository:
2.  Upload the dataset to your Google Drive or local environment.
3.  Open the `End-to-end_Multi-class_Dog_Breed_Classification.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or your Jupyter environment.
4.  Update the data paths in the notebook to point to the location of your dataset.
5.  Run the cells in the notebook sequentially.

## Project Structure

- `End-to-end_Multi-class_Dog_Breed_Classification.ipynb`: The main Colab notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- `/content/drive/MyDrive/Dog vison/`: (Example) Directory where the dataset is stored (customize this path).
- `labels.csv`: CSV file containing image IDs and their corresponding dog breeds.
- `/content/drive/MyDrive/Dog vison/train/`: Directory containing the training images.

## Model Architecture

This project uses a transfer learning approach with a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub. The specific model used will be detailed in the notebook. The model is adapted for 120 output classes (dog breeds).

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the following metric:

- **Log Loss:** The Kaggle competition uses log loss as the primary evaluation metric.

## Results

Will be added ASAP.

## Future Work

- Experiment with different pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub.
- Implement data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
- Explore different hyperparameters for training.
- Deploy the trained model as a web service or mobile application.
